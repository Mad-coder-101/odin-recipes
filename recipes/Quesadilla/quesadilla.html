    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        I had something like this at a restaurant last night and had to try duplicating it at home. This potato quesadilla reminds me of a pierogi. I think this recipe can be played up with just about anything you like with potatoes. This can be a super-fast meal if you use the heat and serve bacon and premade mashed potatoes.

        <li>Stir together mashed potatoes, bacon, and green onions. Spread mashed potato mixture onto 4 tortillas, spreading to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Sprinkle shredded Cheddar cheese on top of mashed potatoes and top with remaining tortillas. Lightly butter each side of quesadilla.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Place a quesadilla into the preheated pan; cook until golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining quesadillas. Serve with salsa and sour cream.</li>
